# The-Ultimate-OmniBuilder-Agent-Blueprint
OmniBuilder's core function is to be an autonomous developer, researcher, and executor, capable of planning, building, coding, debugging, and managing projects end-to-end directly within the user's Visual Studio Code (IDE) and Terminal (CLI) environment. The architecture must prioritize autonomy, safety, and deep environmental awareness.
